# WORKLOG

## 2025-10-04T10:26:07Z — Phase 1.1 Kickoff
- Established project scaffold for TPOT Community Graph Analyzer (docs/, src/, tests/, scripts/ directories).
- Captured ADR 001 choosing API-first + SQLite cache architecture.
- Pending: implement Supabase config module and cached data fetcher (src/config.py, src/data/fetcher.py).

## 2025-10-04T00:00:00Z — Phase 1.2 Planning
- Drafted ADR 002 proposing graph construction + baseline metrics (PageRank, Louvain, betweenness).
- Identified deliverables: graph builder utilities, metrics module, CLI analysis script, unit tests.
- Awaiting stakeholder sign-off before implementation.

## 2025-10-04T12:00:00Z — Phase 1.2 Implementation (in progress)
- Added graph builder/metrics/seed modules and CLI (`scripts/analyze_graph.py`).
- Drafted React+d3 explorer stub for interactive parameter tuning (data expected from CLI output).
- Introduced tests for graph construction, metrics, and seed parsing (local run hit macOS numpy segfault; needs manual verification on adopter machine).
