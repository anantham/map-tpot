# Data Integrity Fix: Metrics vs DB Validation

## Problem

**Original Bug**: Policy decisions based ONLY on `scrape_run_metrics` table, not actual database state.

### Example Scenario
```
scrape_run_metrics.followers_captured = 95
shadow_edge.count(followers) = 3  (corrupted sidebar data)

OLD LOGIC: Skip re-scraping because metrics say "95 captured"
BUG: Never validates that DB actually has 95 edges!
```

## Root Cause

`_should_refresh_list()` in `enricher.py` checked:
- ✅ Metrics table: How many we SAID we captured
- ❌ Edge table: How many we ACTUALLY stored

**Result**: Corrupted data went undetected and was never repaired.

---

## Solution Implemented

### New Validation Logic (enricher.py:456-487)

```python
# Step 1: Check metrics (as before)
last_captured = last_metrics.followers_captured  # e.g., 95

# Step 2: NEW - Also check actual DB edges
edge_summary = self._store.edge_summary_for_seed(seed.account_id)
actual_edge_count = edge_summary.get(list_type, 0)  # e.g., 3

# Step 3: Compare both
MIN_RAW_TO_RETRY = 5

if last_captured <= MIN_RAW_TO_RETRY:
    return (True, "low_captured_count_in_metrics")

# CRITICAL NEW CHECK
if actual_edge_count <= MIN_RAW_TO_RETRY:
    LOGGER.warning(
        "⚠️  DATA INTEGRITY CHECK: metrics show %d captured, but DB only has %d edges!",
        last_captured, actual_edge_count
    )
    return (True, "metrics_db_mismatch_corruption_detected")
```

## What This Catches

### Scenario 1: Sidebar Leak Corruption (Original Bug)
```
Metrics: 95 followers captured
DB:      3 actual edges stored

Detection: ⚠️  CORRUPTION DETECTED
Action:    Force re-scrape to repair
```

### Scenario 2: Incomplete Write
```
Metrics: 50 followers captured
DB:      2 actual edges stored

Detection: ⚠️  CORRUPTION DETECTED (partial write failure)
Action:    Force re-scrape to complete data
```

### Scenario 3: Clean Data
```
Metrics: 50 followers captured
DB:      48 actual edges stored

Detection: ✅ Both checks pass (close enough accounting for dedup)
Action:    Skip re-scraping, data looks clean
```

### Scenario 4: Legitimate Empty
```
Metrics: 0 followers captured
DB:      0 actual edges stored

Detection: ✅ Consistent (account truly has 0 followers)
Action:    Re-scrape allowed due to low count (may have gained followers)
```

---

## Impact

### Before Fix
- **False Confidence**: Metrics said "we have 95", skipped re-scraping
- **Hidden Corruption**: Bad data stayed in DB indefinitely
- **Manual Detection Required**: User had to notice and manually fix

### After Fix
- **Automatic Detection**: Compares metrics vs reality
- **Self-Healing**: Forces re-scrape when mismatch detected
- **Logged Warnings**: Clear visibility when corruption is found

---

## Testing

### Simulation Results

**Original Bug Scenario:**
```
Metrics: followers_captured = 95
DB Reality: actual edges = 3

OLD LOGIC: ❌ Would SKIP (trusts metrics)
NEW LOGIC: ✅ Would RE-SCRAPE (detects mismatch)
```

**Current State (@373staff):**
```
Metrics: followers_captured = 89
DB Reality: actual edges = 97

OLD LOGIC: ✅ Would SKIP (metrics sufficient)
NEW LOGIC: ✅ Would SKIP (both metrics AND DB look good)
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/shadow/enricher.py`
   - Method: `_should_refresh_list()` (lines 429-512)
   - Added: DB edge count validation
   - Added: Corruption detection logic

2. `src/data/shadow_store.py`
   - Method: `edge_summary_for_seed()` (already existed)
   - Returns: `{"following": <count>, "followers": <count>, "total": <count>}`

---

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additional Validations

1. **Post-Capture Validation** (Issue #2)
   - Validate captured_count <= claimed_total
   - Detect impossible scenarios (e.g., captured 5 when claimed total = 0)

2. **Threshold Tolerance**
   - Currently uses exact count comparison
   - Could add tolerance: `abs(metrics - db) / metrics < 0.1` (10% variance OK)

3. **Corruption History Tracking**
   - Log detected corruption events to separate table
   - Track which accounts frequently trigger mismatch alerts
