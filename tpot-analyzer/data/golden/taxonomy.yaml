simulacrum:
  description: >
    Simulacrum Levels distinguish meaning, intention and form of a message.
    Classify based on apparent intent — what the author seems to be doing —
    not the surface form of the words or the effect on the reader.
    Output a probability distribution across all four levels.

  levels:
    l1:
      name: "The Map"
      definition: >
        The speaker is trying to convey true information because it is true.
        They are truth-tracking: if they discovered they were wrong, they
        would stop saying it. This is modeling the territory directly.
        The path of Power over the material world — sharing an accurate,
        elegant map. Often introspective, observational, empirical, curious.
      key_test: "If the speaker found out they were wrong, would they retract it?"
      examples:
        positive:
          - tweet: >
              feel your feelings ≠ despairing. despairing as a mental action
              is just some kind of tension i think. maybe it's a way i try to
              avoid feeling grief or helplessness. despairing leads to
              rumination, cloudedness, depression
            note: >
              Clean phenomenological observation. No audience modeling, no tribal
              signal. Reporting something actually noticed about inner states.
            distribution: {l1: 0.85, l2: 0.05, l3: 0.10, l4: 0.00}

          - tweet: >
              Can you point at where I'm posthoc predicting here? Genomic
              predictors are working for nearly every phenotype we can name and
              probably phenotypes you think are entirely cultural. Would you
              predict that social trust is heritable before hand or would you
              think that's just purely social?
            context: >
              Reply in a debate. @virgil_30 accused lu_sichu of post-hoc
              prediction. lu_sichu is defending an empirical position.
            note: >
              Genuine empirical defense. The challenge framing has a slight L2
              rhetorical quality but the core is truth-tracking — engaging with
              evidence on its merits.
            distribution: {l1: 0.80, l2: 0.15, l3: 0.05, l4: 0.00}

        negative:
          - tweet: "Studies show people who wake up early earn 23% more"
            looks_like: l1
            is_actually: l2
            note: >
              Statistic may be true but is selected and deployed to induce
              behavior change, not to inform. The choice of this fact over
              others is audience-tracking, not truth-tracking.

    l2:
      name: "The Persuasion"
      definition: >
        The speaker is trying to get you to believe X so you will do or say
        what they want. They are audience-tracking, not truth-tracking. The
        content is selected and shaped to serve a goal — the listener's mind
        is being modeled and the map warped to elicit a desirable action.
        Best L2 is indistinguishable from L1 on the surface.
        The path of Status and social control.
      key_test: "Would the speaker say the opposite if it served their goals equally well?"
      examples:
        positive:
          - tweet: >
              just as we shift the goal post on AGI we've been doing the same
              for magic. oh prayer is just relevance realization? no dude
              that's magic. tarot cards are just projection? nope. magic.
              jhanas are just predictive processing? wrong again bucko
            context: >
              Self-thread. Parent tweet: "if you had no idea what you were
              looking at mathematics might as well be magic."
            note: >
              The rhetorical move is: collapse your categories until 'magic'
              is the only word left. This is reframing to induce a belief
              shift, not truth-sharing. "Wrong again bucko" is the tell.
            distribution: {l1: 0.20, l2: 0.55, l3: 0.25, l4: 0.00}

        negative:

              Here's the actual mechanism: cortisol peaks at 6am, which is
              why early rising correlates with alertness in morning-type people
            looks_like: l2
            is_actually: l1
            note: >
              Looks like persuasion (presenting data to change behavior) but
              the author's intent is accurate mechanistic modeling. No normative
              claim, no implied action. Key tell: no "therefore you should X."

    l3:
      name: "The Signal"
      definition: >
        The speaker is saying something as a slogan or symbol to tell you
        what tribe or faction they belong to, or what type of person they are.
        The truth value of the statement is essentially irrelevant — what
        matters is the signal. Signalling by sheep: to blend in, to support
        the integrity of the Egregore they are part of. Channel the hive.
        The speaker would say this even if they weren't sure it was true.
      key_test: "Would the speaker say this even if they discovered it was false?"
      examples:
        positive:
          - tweet: >

              Parent: "when i say 'ive been thinking a lot about this' i mean
              'i keep having this same thought over and over'"
            note: >
              The content is genuine self-reflection (L1) but the specific
              language — naming the ideological lineage being left behind —
              is doing tribal positioning. "Bottomfeeder self-flagellating
              Catholic anticapitalist memes in the groundwater" signals which
              team you're leaving and which you're joining. L1 content in an L3
              register. Classify by primary signal weight.
            distribution: {l1: 0.55, l2: 0.10, l3: 0.35, l4: 0.00}

          - tweet: >
              The true face is not an obliterated, emotionless personality, &
              if you're using Dharma to rationalize greed, dishonesty & sexual
              misconduct, you've gone off the cliff.
              Most of the West Coast has gone off the cliff
            note: >
              First sentence is genuine L1 dharma teaching. Last sentence is
              pure L3 tribal boundary-drawing — "West Coast" as a geographic
              marker for a specific spiritual subculture being rejected. One
              tweet, two levels. Distribute accordingly.

              Any scenario where the probablistically optimal move is to submit
              to an authority defined by the terms of the hypothetical is a
              blender statement and makes for bad decision theory. To get better
              TDT, you need scenarios where the correct move is not cooperation
              with blackmailers.
            looks_like: l3
            is_actually: l1
            note: >
              Discussing TDT/Newcomb is an in-group shibboleth (the topic
              signals tribe) but the tweet itself is making a precise logical
              argument. The content is truth-tracking, not tribal. Classify
              the content, not the topic.
            distribution: {l1: 0.80, l2: 0.05, l3: 0.15, l4: 0.00}

    l4:
      name: "The Simulacrum"
      definition: >
        The symbol and its referent have detached and taken on their own
        existence. The speaker is not choosing words — they are a substrate
        for a self-perpetuating cultural pattern. No individual agent is
        making a meaningful choice about what to say. The meme is running
        the speaker. This is culture, Sanskara, habits and rituals that
        exist across many humans and feed themselves.
        Nations, fiat currency, political slogans operating independently
        of any individual's belief.
      key_test: "Is there any sense in which an individual agent chose these specific words?"
      note: >
        L4 is primarily a system-level phenomenon. For individual tweets,
        flag as L4 only when the tweet is a culturally-scripted phrase repeated
        with no evidence of individual processing — a meme so ossified that
        removing the author's name would make it completely anonymous.
        When uncertain between L3 and L4, lean L3. Mark L4 annotations as
        requiring human review.
      examples:
        positive:
          - tweet: "[PENDING — human annotator to provide examples]"
            note: >
              Candidates: ritual phrases, meme formats with zero original
              thought, slogans repeated verbatim from a political/cultural
              movement with no personal adaptation.

# AXIS B: FUNCTIONAL TYPE
# What social/communicative role does this tweet play?
# One or two labels per tweet. Not mutually exclusive.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
functional:
  description: >
    What is this tweet doing socially? This is orthogonal to simulacrum level —
    any functional type can operate at any simulacrum level.

  types:
    obvious:
      definition: >
        If you invert the tweet everyone would disagree — it's a tautology
        with no information content. Saying something obvious.

    meta:
      definition: >
        Simulacrum-level shifts within the tweet are visible — the tweet
        is commenting on the level of discourse itself.

    aggression:
      definition: >
        Clearly and explicitly aggressive content aimed at stoking conflict,
        often along cultural fault lines.

    dialectics:
      definition: >
        Discusses or debates ideas, inviting or engaging in discourse.
        Thesis and antithesis forming synthesis.

    personal:
      definition: >
        About the author's own life, experiences, or inner states.

    information:
      definition: >
        Sharing facts, observations, or announcements. Neutral factual content.

    commentary:
      definition: >
        Opinions on news or current events. Topical takes aimed at getting
        you to have an opinion on something you cannot influence.

    insight:
      definition: >
        Written to deconflate concepts confused in mainstream narratives.
        The author shows discernment, confidence in direct experience,
        and shares that clarity.

    advertising:
      definition: >
        Aimed at establishing status, farming reputation, or convincing
        you to purchase something or feel respect/insecurity.

    art:
      definition: >
        Aesthetically oriented. Uses media, music, photos, or language
        to point to truth non-intellectually, leaving space for multiple
        interpretations.

    alignment:
      definition: >
        About AI alignment, safety, or related technical/philosophical
        concerns.
